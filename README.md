This portfolio site is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme, it's a futher development of the Astro Sphere by markhorn-dev and few other.

It is primarily Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, with a very small amount of SolidJS for stateful components. But added some reactjs to add my new features.
